\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec.conclusions}
In this project report we have described a multi-device photo browser
application developed to user share and manipulate photos on a multi-touch
surface. During the development process we had to take some decisions during the
architectural and implementation processes, each having advantages and
drawbacks. The drawbacks of the currently implemented communication mechanism
are discussed in section \ref{sec.discussion}.
